Firewall Configuration Documentation :

1] Opening Windows Defender Firewall :

- Opened Control Panel and launched "Windows Defender Firewall"

- Clicked “Advanced settings” to access the full firewall configuration screens.

2] Viewing Inbound Rules :

- Selected "Inbound Rules" to review existing rules.

- Verified current rules and noted the list before making changes.

3] Creating a Block Rule for Port 23 (Telnet) :

- Clicked "New Rule" and choose "Port"

- Selected "TCP" and specified port number 23.

- Choose "Block the connection" applied to all profiles.

- Named rule Block Telnet port 23.

4] Testing the Block Rule :

- Used Python command to test port connectivity:

python -m http.server 23

And

python -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(); print(s.connect_ex(('localhost', 23)))"
Observed the command output was 0, meaning the block rule was not effective.

5] Troubleshooting :

- Checked for conflicting rules, confirmed the block rule was enabled for all profiles.

- Verified that the Windows Firewall was ON.

- Attempted to test with telnet, but utilities were not installed.

6] Creating an Allow Rule for SSH (Port 22) :

- Clicked "New Rule" in Inbound Rules, selected "Port".

- Selected "TCP" and specified port number 22.

- Choose "Allow the connection" for all profiles.

- Named rule Allow SSH port 22.

7] Restoring Firewall State :

Deleted the block rule for port 23 to bring firewall back to its original state.

8] Proof and Screenshots :

Saved screenshots of:

The inbound rules list showing block/allow rules.

The rule configuration dialogs.

Terminal showing command tests.

9] Summarizing about Firewall Filter Traffic :

Firewall rules act as gatekeepers for network traffic, allowing or blocking connections based on defined criteria such as ports, applications, and protocols. The rules created—one to block inbound connections on Telnet port 23 and another to allow connections on SSH port 22—demonstrate how a firewall can granularly regulate access.

A block rule for port 23 prevents potential attacks by stopping unauthorized Telnet traffic, a protocol known for security vulnerabilities. An allow rule for port 22 ensures that secure SSH traffic needed for legitimate remote management is permitted. By specifying which ports or programs are allowed or denied, the firewall enforces the organization’s network policies, reduces exposure to threats, and protects sensitive resources from unwanted access.

This selective filtering strengthens overall security by ensuring only trusted services are reachable, helping to prevent unwanted intrusions and data breaches while maintaining accessibility for critical, secure operations
